Project Requirements:

Create a Qt application to render digital signals satisfying the following:
-Functional requirements:
-Provide the following basic feature set:
-Import data files formatted as described below.
-Render the data on a widget. Please use the attached UI prototype for reference.
-[Optional feature, desirable] Provide a zoom feature for the rendering widget.
-Dataset size: 300k points or more. Please note that such an amount of data is tricky to repaint each time, so please consider
a more effective solution.

Input File Format:
TIMESTEP;100; // time delta
UNITS;ns; // time units
... // arbitrary amount of lines with additional info
DATA; // a keyword that marks the start of a dataset
1; // signal value at 0 nanoseconds
1; // signal value at 100 nanoseconds
0; // signal value at 200 nanoseconds


Non-functional requirements:
-Version control requirements:
	Use git repository.
	Publish the code and share the link with us.
-Development environment and build requirements:
	Use CMake as a build automation tool.
T-esting requirements:
	[Optional] Integrate Google test library into the project.
	[Optional] Add a few tests for the most critical part of the application.
Other requirements:
	-Avoid using third-party libraries except for the Qt Framework and GoogleTest.
	-Spend at most 10 hours on the project
